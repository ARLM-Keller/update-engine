= Update Engine Testing and Code Coverage =

The Update Engine engineering team is very proud of the level of unit
testing and test coverage achieved.  Every source file in `Common` and
`Core` has a corresponding unit test.


== Running With Coverage ==

The Update Engine Xcode project is already set up to generate coverage when
the tests are run in Debug mode.  To see the coverage for Update Engine,
build and run the "Test All" target.  Once it's finished doing its thing,
drag and drop your `build` directory on top of 
[http://code.google.com/p/coverstory/ CoverStory].

To filter out the Google Toolbox for Mac source files, which we don't
compltely exercise in our tests, enter `/update-engine/C` in the search box
at the bottom of the !CoverStory window.
