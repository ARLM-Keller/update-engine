The EngineRunner command is one of the Update Engine sample programs.
It is a command-line tool that exposes some useful bits of Update Engine
functionality.  You can use it to experiment with Update Engine, or to
maintain ticket stores, or even to run the update process for your applicaton.
You can include the code directly in your application, or include 
the EngineRunner command in your application bundle and call it directly
with NSTask or

== Command Syntax ==

The syntax for EngineRunner is

`EngineRunner _command_ -arg1 value -arg2 value -arg3 value ...`

To see all of the commands supported by EngineRunner, run it without
any commands.  To see help on a given command run 

`EngineRunner _command_ -help`

This will show you the optional and required parameters.

== Running an Update ==

To run an update, provide all of the information for the product on the
command line:

`EngineRunner run -productid com.greeble.hoover -version 1.2 -url http://example.com/updateInfo`

If you want to see if your application would be considered updatable, use the `dryrun` command.  That goes through the motions of updating, but doesn't actually donwload or run anything.

== Manipulating Tickets ==

If you have several products you're managing, 

{{{
    $ EngineRunner add
          -store /tmp/store.tix
          -productid com.greeble.hoover
          -version 1.2
          -url http://example.com/updateInfo
          -xcpath /Applications/Greebleator.app
    Products that would update:
      com.greeble.hoover
}}}
